# Project Name

> Collaborative DJing in your browser

Begin making your own beats leveraging the built in sampler, effects, and fully-additive synthesizer. You can upload your own samples by simply dragging and dropping with in the sampler, as well as mix across channels by manipulating gain and tempo.

Most importantly, you can record your sesssions and share with friends or join the same room and mix together in real time from anywhere with an internet connection.
